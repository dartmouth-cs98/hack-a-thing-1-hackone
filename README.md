# Hack-a-thing 1
## Will Sanford and Alex Quill

### What we attempted to build
We both wanted to get more familiar with designing, building and training nearual networks, specifically with TensorFlow.
More specifically this is what each of use were looking to build with this.
- Alex 
- Will : I did some simple intro tutorials and tried to make some predictions with healthcare data. I mostly wanted to try to extend and build some larger custom model
that could be used for something more substantial. I had been reading a lot about how people were building networks to identify deepfakes, and spent alot of time 
build a network that would do a similar style of thing. I never got to make a custom training loop to actually train the network for a specific task, but I think the architecture 
is quite interesting and could be extended to a lot of applications that work off a video feed.
### Who did what
- Alex 
- Will : I spent my time approxiametly as follows: ~3 hours of YouTube tutorials, ~3 hours working through 'Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow' by Aurelien Geron that I borrowed from a friend.
~ 1.5 hours on tutorials and trying my own regression on healthcare data from (I only added the Housing Prices regression tutorial as all the tutorials were essentially the same). ~3 hours trying to build a model that could 
analyze video data

### What you learned 
- Alex 
- Will : I spent a lot of my time trying to learn how to build custom models (outside of Keras Sequential), which I think you 
would need to be able to do if you wanted to anything past one of the tutorials we worked on. I learned a lot about how to make these
from scratch and build your own custom training loops.

### What didn't work
- Alex 
- Will: For me, I think so much of using neural nets and a lot of machine learning is spent getting the right data and designing 
the proper network for your problem. When I tried to make something happen with healthcare data, the data turned out to be
nearly unusable for what I was trying to do. I think a lot of time needs to be spent on planning and researching before any code is actually 
written. I tried to do this a lot more in the video analyzing exercise, which turned out way better.
